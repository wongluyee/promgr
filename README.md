# ProMGR

<b>Description:</b>
It is an app that allows managers to manage their teams easily. 

<b>Target User:</b>
Line managers in large corporations are responsible for delegating tasks efficiently, managing team performance (helping members complete tasks and achieve perfomance goals) and monitor team activity.

<b>Problem:</b>
The problem is that data needed to make management decisions is typically segregated across multiple apps. For example, if a manager with a team of 10 wants to assign a task to someone appropriate and with few ongoing tasks, he has to check a Trello board with over 100 tasks displayed and check individual timesheets to get the overtime information. Shifting through these apps takes time and the workflow process is not smooth, the larger the team becomes the time taken to make decisions is compounded.

<b>Solution:</b>
With ProMGR, managing teams become easy. Summarized data for team performance is available on the dashboard, allowing managers to plan activities and monitor performance efficiently.

<b>Development Process:</b>
The development process first started with brainstorming user needs, followed by protoyping UI design and user journeys in Figma, then breaking down tasks and listing them in Trello. Our team also ensured minimal bugs by reviewing code before pushing to Github.
